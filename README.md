## Specs

When a user enters a number it is returned.
When a user enters a number divisible by 3, return "ping".
When a user enters a number divisible by 5, return "pong".
When a user returns a number divisible by 15, return "ping-pong".
User can enter any number into the field and get a return that counts to that number.


## Description

A web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:

Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"

A user will be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.
